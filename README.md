# ToDolist

its an web app where u can keep track of what u are doing daily
it is not completed at only the front end is complete
back end will be wrtten using java servlets


in this app u can add ur tasks and delete them even edit them


so basic idea is whatever u add will be sent to the servlet where using jdbc we will save it to database
and if u want to view the todo list u will get it directly from database

i will use html,css(bootstrap) and jquery(just to redirect to same page when u delete an entry from list)


in backend wil use servlets,jdbc and might also convert the html front end into jsp for dynamic response display



im an beginner so the design of the page might not be up to ur standards
